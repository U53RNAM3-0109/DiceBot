This is a template for a simple dice bot!
To use, simply paste your token into it's place (in main.py) and run.

This comes with a few commands that require admin use only,
but I'm not clever enough to find out permissions, so I've got them set to my own ID.
You can change this to a list of other valid IDs yourself.
